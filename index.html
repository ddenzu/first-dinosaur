    <h2>What is a dinosaurs</h2>
    <img src="asdf.png" width="10%">
    <p><strong><u>Dinosaurs</u></strong> are a diverse group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" 
        target="_blank" title="파충류">reptiles</a> of the clade Dinosauria.<br>
        They first appeared during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic target="_blank title="트라이아스기">
        Triassic</a> period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), 
        although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research.<br>
        They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya; 
        their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.<br> The fossil record shows
        that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch,<br>
        and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya.<br>
        Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and paraphyletic pseudo-extinct non-avian dinosaurs,
        which are all dinosaurs other than birds.</p>
